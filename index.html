            <p> Hi, I'm Aaron. Some of my friends call me Ron.</p>
            <p> 
                This is the first "portfolio" am am developing for myself in the start to my journey as a 
                developer. This site will showcase some of my past experiences interests ranging from work, college, and general in life. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have multi-disciplinary experience, and a ranging set of strengths. I have experience with marketing and brand creation, 
                working in a beauty marketing position in college before starting my journey as a developer. I have always possessed an
                interest in consumer product development -- specifically fashion. However, I love the challenge and correctness of software
                development. After taking three courses in college and enjoying the process of development, I was insprired to try to continue
                learning and growing. I would love to find a position where I could combine some of my creative and technical interests. 
            </p>

                Feel free to scroll through the website to learn more about what I enjoy, and what I've done.
