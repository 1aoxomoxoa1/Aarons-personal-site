                <p>
                   I like learning languages and being able to interact with people from other cultures. I've enjoyed speaking 
                   spanish a lot with my friends from Los Angeles. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that I think about it, leaning Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript also count toward my love of learning languages.

                    <p> I've tried a lot of the activities offered on campus here at UCLA -- from racketball to volleyball to swimming.
                        For me, one that stuck over the college years is swimming. I like to break up stressful days with a swim outside
                        in the sun.

                    <p> Another activity that I have enjoyed since high school is skateboarding. I like the challenge that it presents and the
                        community that surrounds skateboarding. I hope to keep skating when I move to Tel Aviv, and meet the Israeli skate 
                        community.
