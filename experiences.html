                <p> I recently graduated with a degree in economics from UCLA. I learned lots of basic micro and macro economics concepts.
                    Although I didn't go down the finance or investment banking pathway (except for one internship), I hope that I can make use of 
                    these financial thinking skills at some point in my career.

                <p> My most recent work experience was as an intern for a beauty marketing company. I worked the job
                    part-time for a year between the summer after my junior year and the start of the summer after I graduated. I thought this 
                    was a great experience for me to work within a team more frequently and learn to communicate more effectively in a work 
                    setting. I also enjoyed the work itself -- thinking about trends and making predictions within the men's grooming space.
                    Specifically, as one of the fewer men on the marketing team, they had me giving insight and direction into their newest 
                    men's brand -- a progressive hair day brand for men at retail.

                <p>
                    I also have interest and experience living and working internationally. My first international experience was a 
                    month long study abroad experience in Spain, where I was able to practice Spanish that I learned growing up in high 
                    school. I enjoyed speaking to people with different experiences and perspectives than me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am looking forward to living and working internationally again soon in 2023 in Israel. I'm looking forward to the 
                    new perspectives and experiences that I will encounter.
